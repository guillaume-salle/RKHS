# Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces

This is a project done for the evaluation of the course 'Apprentissage statistique' of Gerard Biau at Sorbonne University.

Our material was the first chapter of the book: Reprocuding Kernel Hilbert Spaces in Probability and Statistics, by Alain Berlinet and Christine Thomas-Agnan, 2001.
I did mainly the part on the theory of RKHS and my partner did the part on classification applications.
